		<p>Working with Linuxjobber is very trendy. Our work moves with the pace of technology according to our clients' requests. This means that many of the positions are remote and involve telecommuting requiring professionals to be self disciplined and work without supervision. Unlike traditional companies that measure office time, we measure output. Consequently, it takes certain personalities to fit into the Linuxjobber culture and people who enjoy the culture often turn out to be super-excited with Linuxjobber. If you feel that you are a self-starter and a technically inclined person, please find and apply for any position of your interest below and we will be happy to consider you. It takes FUN! </p>
