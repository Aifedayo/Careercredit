                                to be reported for income tax purposes. For example, for U.S. individual taxpayers for the 2018 tax year, this includes the sum of: (a) line 1

                                related party.

                                than your U.S. federal income tax return, provided that the documentation is another verifiable source acceptable to Company. All references

                                <p style="font-weight: 700; padding-bottom: 2px;">3. LINUXJOBBER AS ISA PROGRAM MANAGER</p><br>
                                You hereby consent to LINUXJOBBER acting as the agent of Company and managing and processing all aspects of this Agreement, including but not
                                limited to monitoring your Earned Income in your Approved Bank Account, processing payments, and performing reconciliations. You
                                further agree to cooperate with all requests made by LINUXJOBBER in connection with your compliance with terms and conditions of this Agreement,
                                including by providing information, documents, and authorizations, as requested from time to time.<br><br>
                                <p style="font-weight: 700; padding-bottom: 2px;">4. MAKING PAYMENTS FROM EARNED INCOME.</p><br>
                                a. Payment Term. Your Payment Term will start 4 months from completion of or withdrawal from your Program or Training, whichever
                                occurs first. However, your obligation to make Monthly Payments will occur only if you are earning the Qualified Monthly Earned Income
                                or as otherwise provided herein. Your Payment Term will end upon Payment Satisfaction.<br><br>
                                b. Reporting of all Earned Income. Upon completion of your Program or Training and throughout the Payment Term, you agree to use the
                                LINUXJOBBER Platform to communicate: (i) all employment positions you accept including, if requested, a description of the business and products or
                                services provided by each Employer and the nature of your position with each Employer; (ii) your base salary for each employment position;
                                and (iii) your projected annual gross Earned Income.You further agree during the Payment Term to update through the LINUXJOBBER Platform any
                                changes in your projected annual gross Earned Income within thirty (30) days of any event giving rise to such change.<br><br>
                                c. Monthly Payment Based on Projected Earned Income. Based on the projected Earned Income you report to LINUXJOBBER, subject to reconciliation
                                as provided below, you shall pay Company a Monthly Payment for each month in which you have Qualified Monthly Earned Income.<br><br>
                                d. Methods of Payment. Prior to or upon commencement of the Payment Term, you agree to elect one of following options for recurring
                                Monthly Payments and any other payment(s) owing under this Agreement:<br><br>
                                i. electronic funds transfers from your Approved Bank Account; or<br><br>
                                ii. payments by credit card.<br><br>
                                You agree to execute authorizations and any other documentation necessary for LINUXJOBBER to implement your election.<br><br>
                                e. Withdrawal of Authorization for Preauthorized Electronic Funds Transfers. You have the right at any time to revoke your prior
                                authorization for electronic funds transfers, subject to providing LINUXJOBBER at least three (3) business days’ notice prior to a scheduled payment.
                                Should you elect to do so, revocation will not relieve you of your obligation to make Monthly Payments or any other payment(s) hereunder,
                                and you agree to pay by credit card. If at any time during the Payment Term your circumstances will not permit payment of the Monthly
                                Payment through electronic funds transfers from your Approved Bank Account or by credit card, you may contact LINUXJOBBER to request a
                                reasonable alternative method of payment of your Monthly Payment, which LINUXJOBBER may or may not accept in its sole discretion.<br><br>

                                f. Approved Bank Account.<br><br>
                                i. Set Up and Maintenance of Approved Bank Account. You agree that, prior to receiving any Earned Income, you will establish a bank
                                account with a financial institution designated or approved by LINUXJOBBER in writing (“Approved Bank Account”) and also will permit integration of
                                the Approved Bank Account with LINUXJOBBER’s Platform as necessary to permit LINUXJOBBER to track your Earned Income, monitor account activity and
                                balances, perform reconciliations and, if elected by you, process and withdraw your Monthly Payments from your Approved Bank Account.
                                You further agree to provide details of the Approved Bank Account as LINUXJOBBER may reasonably request from time to time. If for any reason (e.g.,
                                a change in your employment or address), you would like to change your Approved Bank Account to another bank, you agree to give LINUXJOBBER
                                prior notice of the requested change and such details for the proposed replacement account as LINUXJOBBER may reasonably request. The proposed
                                replacement account shall be subject to LINUXJOBBER’s prior approval. If at any time during the Payment Term you change the password to your

                                Approved Bank Account or otherwise take any action that alters the ability of LINUXJOBBER to access your Approved Bank Account, you agree to give
                                LINUXJOBBER prompt notice of the change and to comply with all requests of LINUXJOBBER to integrate the new Approved Bank Account with the LINUXJOBBER
                                Platform.<br><br>
                                ii. Right to Require Change of Approved Bank Account. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, and even if you already have an Approved
                                Bank Account, you acknowledge that LINUXJOBBER may require you during the Payment Term to open and maintain a new account with a financial
                                institution designated by LINUXJOBBER, and you agree that, upon notice from LINUXJOBBER, that you will promptly open a new account with the designated
                                financial institution and that such account shall then become your Approved Bank Account. You further agree to execute all documents
                                required to open the new Approved Bank Account including, if applicable, authorization for automatic payments from the new Approved
                                Bank Account. You also agree to authorize integration of the Approved Bank Account with the LINUXJOBBER Platform to permit LINUXJOBBER to monitor your
                                EarnedIncome, among other things.<br><br>
                                g. Deposit of all Earned Income into Approved Bank Account. You agree that during the entire Payment Term you shall deposit all Earned
                                Income received by you from any and all sources directly into your Approved Bank Account. If you are employed, you agree to cause your
                                Employer to arrange for the direct deposit of all of your Earned Income to your Approved Bank Account. Your refusal or failure to establish
                                the Approved Bank Account or to permit integration with the LINUXJOBBER Platform for the purpose of making Monthly Payments or other payments
                                hereunder shall not relieve you of any of your obligations under this Agreement.<br><br>
                                h. Payment Deferrals and Extensions of Payment Term. LINUXJOBBER shall place your ISA in deferment status and not accept payments for any month
                                that your Monthly Earned Income does not exceed the Minimum Monthly Amount (a “Deferred Month”), until such time as your Monthly
                                Earned Income exceeds, or is deemed to exceed the Minimum Monthly Amount (as determined by reconciliation, as described herein), at
                                which time your obligation to make Monthly Payments shall be reinstated. There is no limit on the aggregate number of months that Monthly
                                Payments may be deferred.<br><br>
                                i. Survival of Obligations. Expiration of the Payment Term only terminates your obligation to make Monthly Payments from Qualified
                                Monthly Earned Income. However, it does not terminate this ISA or any continuing obligations you may have to Company or LINUXJOBBER pursuant
                                to this ISA, including but not limited to the obligation to make additional payments if LINUXJOBBER determines that you underreported your Earned
                                Income.<br><br>

                                <p style="font-weight: 700; padding-bottom: 2px;">5. RECONCILIATION.</p><br> From time to time during the Payment Term, and for a period of one (1) year following the end of the calendar year
                                in which the Payment Term expires, Company shall have the right to examine and audit your records pertaining to your employment and to
                                verify your Earned Income at any point or points during the Payment Term to ensure that you have properly reported or projected your
                                Earned Income and to verify that LINUXJOBBER has properly calculated and deducted Monthly Payments and other payment owing hereunder
                                (“Reconciliation”). You agree to cooperate with the Company and LINUXJOBBER in the Reconciliation process.<br><br>
                                a. Confirmation of Earned Income and Employment. To permit LINUXJOBBER to perform Reconciliation, you agree that you shall, within thirty (30)
                                days of request:<br><br>
                                i. verify your Earned Income as reported to the IRS by completing and delivering to LINUXJOBBER a IRS Form 4506-T or Form 4506T-EZ (or any
                                successor form) or, at LINUXJOBBER’s option, provide LINUXJOBBER with a true and accurate copy of your federal tax return as submitted to the IRS for any
                                calendar year of the Payment Term;<br><br>
                                ii. provide LINUXJOBBER with the name, address and phone number of any Employers from which you have received Earned Income and authorize
                                each of your Employers to disclose to us all forms of cash and non-cash compensation paid or provided to or earned by you; and<br><br>
                                iii. provide such other documentation including, without limitation, pay stubs, Form W-2s, offer letters, and other information and summaries
                                of any non-written or oral non-cash consideration, equity or deferred compensation arrangements as may be reasonably requested by LINUXJOBBER.<br><br>

                                b. Underreported Earned Income.<br><br>
                                i. If at any time during the Payment Term, whether intentionally or unintentionally, you underreport your Earned Income, resulting in one or
                                more deferred Monthly Payments, or one or more lower Monthly Payments than Company is entitled to receive under this Agreement,
                                Company will have the right to correct the issue, in its discretion, by: (A) increasing your Income Share for Monthly Payments payable to us
                                for each subsequent Qualified Income Earning Month, to a maximum of 150% of Income Share; or (B) adding a fixed monthly
                                underpayment fee which shall not exceed $1,000.00 per month (“Underpayment Fee”), until such time as the discrepancy has been corrected.<br><br>
                                ii. Alternatively, if a Reconciliation shows that you underreported your Earned Income at any time during the Payment Term, so that you
                                made one or more lower Monthly Payments than Company is entitled to receive under this Agreement, LINUXJOBBER shall give you notice within ten
                                (10) days of completion of the Reconciliation of the amount of the underpayment and reasonable documentation of the underpayment
                                calculation. You agree to pay us the aggregate amount of the underpayment within sixty (60) days of receiving such notice. If you do not pay
                                on time, you authorize LINUXJOBBER to deduct the amount of your underpayment from your Approved Bank Account. If the Approved Bank Account
                                is no longer active or there are insufficient funds to pay the underpayment, Company may exercise its legal rights to collect such
                                underpayment. In that case, you agree to pay Company’s reasonable costs of collection, including attorney fees.<br><br>
                                iii. If a Reconciliation shows or you claim that your Derived Monthly Income for any month in which you made a Monthly Payment was less
                                than the amount of Qualified Monthly Earned Income on which such Monthly Payment was calculated, such Monthly Payment will not be
                                reduced or otherwise refunded unless you can demonstrate with documentation reasonably satisfactory to LINUXJOBBER that such payment was the
                                result of a manifest error.<br><br>
                                iv. If a Reconciliation shows that your Derived Monthly Income for any month was more than the amount of Monthly Earned Income you
                                reported for such month, your Monthly Earned Income for that month shall be deemed to equal the Derived Monthly Income, and any
                                additional amounts payable to us will be subject to recapture pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) above, as the case may be.<br><br>

                                c. Overreported Earned Income.<br><br>
                                i. If at any time during the Payment Term, for any reason, you overreport your Earned Income, resulting in larger Monthly Payments than
                                Company is entitled to receive under this Agreement, you will have the right to notify LINUXJOBBER of this and provide any documentation that LINUXJOBBER
                                may reasonably request to verify your claim of overpayment If, after Reconciliation, LINUXJOBBER agrees that you overreported your Earned Income,
                                Company will correct the error, in its discretion, by: (A) refunding the amount of the overpayment to your Approved Bank Account in a
                                single payment or by equal payments over a period not to exceed 6 months; or (B) decreasing your Income Share by not less than 10% for
                                each Monthly Payment, until such time as the overage in payments to Company has been corrected.<br><br>
                                ii. If the Payment Term ends prior to correction of any overage in payments, as determined by Reconciliation, Company shall pay you the
                                balance of any remaining overpayment within thirty (30) days of the end of the Payment Term.<br><br>
                                d. Extension of Time for Reconciliation. If you should file for an extension of the time to file your federal income tax returns or if you fail to
                                provide us with the requested tax, Employer or Earned Income information or you do not otherwise reasonably cooperate with us for
                                purposes of Reconciliation, then the one (1) year period following the end of the calendar year in which the Payment Term expires shall be
                                extended for a period of time equal to the period of time that you failed to provide the requested information or you obtained by filing the
                                extension. It is the intent of this provision that the running of the one (1) year period following the end of the calendar year in which the
                                Payment Term expires shall be extended so that the Company has a full and reasonable opportunity to perform Reconciliation and so that
                                you may not benefit from your failure to comply with your obligations or obtaining an extension.<br><br>

                                Amount.<br><br>
                                <p style="font-weight: 700; padding-bottom: 2px;">7. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS AFFECTING PAYMENTS.</p><br><br>

                                similar arrangements with Company or any other Person that, in the aggregate, obligate you to pay a total Income Share exceeding 30.0% of
                                your Earned Income.<br><br>
                                b. International Work. If you move out of the United States during your Payment Term, you agree to continue to report Earned Income and
                                to continue paying your Income Share of Qualified Monthly Earned Income. You shall not be in breach of this Agreement so long as you

                                documentation showing that you have been found to be permanently disabled by the Social Security Administration or other federal or state

                                Term ends, you agree to file timely your U.S. federal income tax returns no later than April 15 of the following year, and to timely file any
                                state or local tax returns by the due date. You agree to notify LINUXJOBBER of any extension you seek for filing federal income tax returns. Moreover,
                                upon request, you agree to sign and file IRS Form 4506-T or Form 4506T-EZ (or any successor form) within thirty (30) days of request,

                                open transaction treatment. Company believes that this tax treatment is more likely than not the proper characterization for federal income
                                tax purposes. Company urges you to consult with your own tax advisors, to ascertain the appropriate manner in which to report your taxes.
                                Company believes that there is a potential benefit if all parties to a transaction report in a consistent fashion. Company encourages you to
                                report in a manner that is consistent for all parties to the transaction. Company recognizes that there may be specific situations where
                                Company or you may find it appropriate to report in a way that is inconsistent with the other party. Company urges you to consult with your
                                tax advisors about the potential consequences of such reporting.<br><br>

                                <p style="font-weight: 700; padding-bottom: 2px;">19. NOTICE AND CURE.</p> Prior to initiating any legal action or other proceeding regarding any past, present or future claim, dispute, or
                                controversy, Company or Obligor may have against the other, regardless of the legal theory on which it is based, arising out of, relating to or
                                occurring in connection with this Agreement (a “Claim”), the party asserting the Claim shall give the other party written notice of the Claim
                                and a reasonable opportunity, not less than thirty (30) days, to resolve the Claim. The notice must explain the nature of the Claim and the
                                relief demanded by the party asserting it. If Company is asserting the Claim, Company will send such notice to you at your address appearing
                                in our records or, if you are known to be represented by an attorney, to your attorney at his or her office address. The party asserting the
                                Claim must reasonably cooperate in providing any information about the Claim that the other party reasonably requests. The provisions of
                                this section shall survive termination of this Agreement.<br><br>
                                <p style="font-weight: 700; padding-bottom: 2px;">20. ARBITRATION OF CLAIMS AGAINST COMPANY.</p> Except as expressly provided below, Obligor agrees that any Claim against the
                                Company shall be submitted to and resolved by binding arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§1 et seq., before
                                the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect (the “AAA Rules”, available online at
                                www.adr.org). If the AAA is unable to serve as administrator and Company and Obligor cannot agree on a replacement, a court with
                                jurisdiction will select the administrator or arbitrator. This means that any Claim you have shall be resolved by a neutral third-party
                                arbitrator, and not by a judge or a jury, and you hereby knowingly and voluntarily waive the right to trial on such Claim by any court of law
                                or equity. For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement: (a) the term “Claim” has the broadest possible meaning, and includes initial claims,
                                counterclaims, cross-claims and third-party claims. It includes disputes based upon contract, tort, consumer rights, fraud and other intentional
                                torts, constitution, statute, regulation, ordinance, common law and equity (including any claim for injunctive or declaratory relief). For
                                purposes of this Arbitration Agreement; (b) the term “Company” includes: (i) the Company; (ii) any assignee of this Agreement; (iii) any
                                assignee, agent, designee or servicer of the Company (including, but not limited to, LINUXJOBBER): (iv) the officers, directors, employees, affiliates,
                                subsidiaries, and parents of all of the foregoing; and (v) any Person named as a co-defendant with Company in a Claim asserted by Obligor,
                                such as servicers and debt collectors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Claim that Obligor wishes to assert against Company is cognizable
                                in a small claims court (or your state’s equivalent court) with jurisdiction over the Claim and the parties, Obligor or Company may pursue
                                such Claim in such court; provided, however, that if the Claim is transferred, removed, or appealed to a different court, it shall then be
                                resolved by arbitration, as provided herein. Moreover, any dispute concerning the validity or enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement
                                must be decided by a court; any dispute concerning the validity or enforceability of this Agreement is for the arbitrator.<br><br>
                                
                                Any arbitration hearing that you attend will take place before a single arbitrator and shall be held in the same city as the U.S. District Court
                                closest to your address. If you cannot obtain a waiver of the AAA’s or arbitrator’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees, Company
                                will consider in good faith any request by you for Company to bear such fees. Each party will bear the expense of its own attorneys, experts
                                and witnesses, regardless of which party prevails, unless applicable law or this Agreement provides a right to recover any of those fees from
                                the other party.<br><br>
                                The arbitrator shall follow applicable substantive law to the extent consistent with the FAA, applicable statutes of limitation and privilege
                                rules that would apply in a court proceeding, but subject to any limitations as may be set forth in this Agreement.<br><br>
                                This Arbitration Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement, your fulfillment of your obligations under this Agreement, and
                                bankruptcy or insolvency by either party (to the extent permitted by applicable law). In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between
                                this Arbitration Agreement and the administrator’s rules or other provisions of this Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement will govern.<br><br>
                                CLASS ACTION WAIVER: IF A CLAIM IS ARBITRATED, OBLIGOR WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A
                                CLASS ACTION, A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION IN COURT OR IN
                                ARBITRATION, EITHER AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER. Further, unless both Obligor and Company agree
                                otherwise in writing, the arbitrator may not join or consolidate Claims with claims of any other Persons. The arbitrator shall have no
                                authority to conduct any class, private attorney general, or other representative proceeding, and shall award declaratory or injunctive relief
                                only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the Claim. If a determination is made in a proceeding involving Company and
                                Obligor that the class action waiver is invalid or unenforceable, only this sentence of this Arbitration Agreement will remain in force and the
                                remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, provided, that the determination concerning the class action waiver shall be
                                subject to appeal.<br><br>
                                RIGHT TO REJECT: You may reject this Arbitration Agreement by emailing a rejection notice to Company at support@LINUXJOBBER.org (or such
                                other email address as Company or LINUXJOBBER may provide to you from time to time) within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date. Any rejection
                                notice must include: (i) your name and address; (ii) your cellular telephone number(s); (iii) your account number, if applicable; and shall
                                state that you are rejecting the Arbitration Agreement in this Agreement. Any rejection of this Arbitration Agreement, will not affect any
                                other provisions of, or your obligations under, this Agreement.<br><br>
                                <p style="font-weight: 700; padding-bottom: 2px;">21. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p> EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY THE WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF COMPANY OR
                                LINUXJOBBER, NEITHER COMPANY NOR LINUXJOBBER SHALL BE LIABLE TO OBLIGOR FOR LOSS OF EMPLOYMENT, LOST INCOME OR
                                PROFITS, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF ADVISED BY
                                OBLIGOR OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 21 SHALL SURVIVE
                                TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.<br><br>
                                <p style="font-weight: 700; padding-bottom: 2px;">22. SURVIVAL OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS.</p> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the provisions of Sections 3
                                (Payment Management by LINUXJOBBER), 5 (Reconciliation), 9 (Tax Reporting), 10 (Covenants and Representations of Obligor), 12 (Breach and

                                Against Company), 22 (Limitation of Liability), and 23 (General Provisions) shall survive termination of this Agreement, your fulfillment of
                                your obligations under this Agreement, and bankruptcy or insolvency of either party (to the extent permitted by applicable law).<br><br>

                                <p style="font-weight: 700; padding-bottom: 2px;">23. GENERAL PROVISIONS.</p><br>

                                c. No Waivers. No delay or failure on the part of either Party to require performance of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a
                                waiver of that provision as to that or any other instance.<br><br>
                                d. Successors and Assigns. Company (and any Person that acquires a majority interest of the equity of Company or substantially all of its

                                without your permission or consent. However, you may not assign this Agreement, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, or any of your

                                unenforceable to any extent, then (i) such provision shall be excluded from this Agreement to the minimum extent necessary so that this

                                provision were so excluded and (iii) the remainder of this Agreement shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.<br><br>
