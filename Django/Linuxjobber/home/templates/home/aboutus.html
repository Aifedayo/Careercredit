			<span>Linux Jobber</span>
				<p>Our company was born out of the need to close the gap between the market's demand for linux professionals and the supply pool of available professionals.</p>
					
				<div class="col-md-12 jobbertext col-xs-12">
					<p>Most people are well aware that nearly all devices now run linux in the back: from android cell phones to smart TVs, it is linux. Also, from embedded car computer controls to airplane movie displays, it is all linux. Most importantly, because linux is much more secure than Microsoft's Windows, many companies now use linux in the backend to provide information security. As a result, the demand for linux professionals today is phenominal. Hence, we have decided to train more people to fill the numerous open positions.</p>
